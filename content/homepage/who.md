My background is in anti-racism work with white people, where I’ve spent years helping individuals and organizations see and **shift deeply ingrained power dynamics**. That experience gives me a sharp, practiced eye for **how power functions in teams**—how it moves, who holds it, how it’s leveraged or denied, and how it shapes every interaction, often in ways people don’t realize.

I don’t believe in neutrality. My job is not to sit back and pretend all perspectives carry equal weight. My job is to **speak truth to power**—compassionately, directly, and with deep care for everyone involved. I **blame systems, not people**, and I recognize that we all move through the world carrying wounds, assumptions, and habits that shape how we engage in teams. I help groups see those patterns clearly so they can choose something different.

People often bring me in thinking their problem is communication. Sometimes, that’s true. But more often, **the problem is trauma**, structural inequities, or unexamined dynamics of control and avoidance. I am here to see what’s really happening and to help your team find ways to function that are clearer, smoother, and more sustainable.

If you want to actually **understand** what’s going on in your team and build a structure that supports your real goals, I can help. If you’re looking for someone to smooth things over without addressing the deeper issues, I’m not the right fit. But if you’re ready for **clarity, honesty, and forward momentum**—let’s talk.
