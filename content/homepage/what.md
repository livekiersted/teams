When teams struggle, they usually think the problem is **communication**—but more often, it’s **trauma, power imbalances, and unmet needs**. I come in, meet with everyone, observe the dynamics firsthand, and figure out **what’s actually going on**.

I work with **teams of all kinds**—colleagues, collectives, polycules, housemates, sports teams—any group that needs to function well together but keeps running into **the same frustrating conflicts**.

My process is immersive and practical. Over several months, I:
- **Meet 1:1** with each person to hear their perspective and gather insights.
- **Facilitate dyads and small groups**, working directly on shifting team dynamics in real-time.
- **Identify underlying patterns**, not just surface-level friction.
- **Pinpoint what’s changeable and what’s not**, so you can make informed decisions.

I don’t blame individuals—I analyze and adjust **systems**. Mammalian nervous systems react under threat, whether or not anyone consents to it. Recognizing this is **key to building functional teams**.

At the end of our work together, I deliver a **sharp, honest assessment** of what’s happening and **clear recommendations for next steps**. If the team wants to continue, I offer **facilitation and ongoing support** to help integrate changes.

I am **clear-sighted, practical, and expert at seeing how power functions in relationships**. If you genuinely want to understand what’s happening in your team and improve how you work together, I can help. If you don’t want to know the truth, I’m not the right person for you. But if you’re ready, let’s figure it out together.
